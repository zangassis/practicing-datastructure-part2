# Practicing Data Structures with ASP.NET Core - Part 2💻

This project contains a sample ASP.NET Core app. This app is an example of the article I produced for the Telerik Blog (telerik.com/blogs).

Welcome to the "Practicing Data Structures" repository! 

In this project, you will find a hands-on guide to learning and implementing advanced data structures like Binary Search, Heap and Hashing using ASP.NET Core. 🚀

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **📂 Program.cs**: Contains the ASP.NET Core Minimal API project where you can explore and practice data structures.
